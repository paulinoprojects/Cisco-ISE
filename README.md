# One Week Study Plan - Cisco Identity Service Engine (ISE)

## Day 1: Understanding Cisco ISE Basics

### Introduction to Cisco ISE

- Learn the purpose and benefits of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) in network security and access control.

### Components and Architecture

- Understand the main components: Policy Service Node (PSN), Policy Administration Node (PAN), Monitoring and Troubleshooting Node (MnT).
- Learn about personas: Administration, Policy, and Monitoring.

## Day 2: Setting Up Your Lab Environment

### Lab Setup

- Create a virtualized lab environment using platforms like VMware or VirtualBox.
- Set up virtual machines for Cisco ISE, network devices, and client systems.

### Installing and Configuring ISE

- Install Cisco ISE on a virtual machine following Cisco's official installation guide.
- Configure initial settings like IP addresses, passwords, and certificates.

## Day 3: Identity and Authentication

### Identity Sources

- Configure identity sources like Active Directory, LDAP, or internal identity stores.
- Understand the order of authentication when users and devices connect.

### Authentication Methods

- Learn about authentication methods like EAP, MAB, and WebAuth.
- Configure authentication policies to control user access.

## Day 4: Network Access Policies

### Creating Access Policies

- Define basic authorization policies to control network access based on user roles and attributes.
- Familiarize yourself with policy conditions, results, and rules.

### Testing Policies

- Create a few simple policies to allow or deny access based on predefined conditions.
- Test policies by connecting devices and users to the network.

## Day 5: Guest and BYOD Access

### Guest Access

- Configure guest access portals and workflows for visitors.
- Understand the guest user journey and authentication methods.

### BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)

- Set up self-registration portals for personal devices.
- Implement posture assessments to ensure devices meet security requirements.

## Day 6: Integration and Troubleshooting

### Integration with Network Devices

- Integrate Cisco ISE with network devices (switches, routers, wireless controllers) using RADIUS or TACACS+.
- Configure network device settings to communicate with ISE.

### Monitoring and Troubleshooting

- Explore the Monitoring and Troubleshooting Node (MnT) persona.
- Learn to use logs and reports for basic troubleshooting and auditing.

## Day 7: Advanced Concepts

### High Availability and Redundancy

- Learn about High Availability (HA) options in Cisco ISE.
- Set up redundant ISE nodes for failover scenarios.

### Security Best Practices

- Familiarize yourself with security best practices for deploying ISE.
- Implement secure communication, proper hardening, and regular updates.

## Further Learning and Resources

### Documentation and Training

- Explore Cisco's official documentation for in-depth information on specific topics.
- Consider enrolling in Cisco training courses or certification programs related to ISE.


By following these steps, new network engineers and administrators can progressively build their knowledge of Cisco ISE, from the basics of deployment to advanced configuration and maintenance.
