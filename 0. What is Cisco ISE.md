# Cisco Identidy Services Engine (ISE)

## What is Cisco ISE
- A security solution that helps organizations control and manage who can access their computer networks and resources. 
- It acts like a gatekeeper, making sure only authorized users and devices can connect to the network while keeping out unauthorized ones. 
- ISE checks the identity of users and devices, like laptops or smartphones, before allowing them to access the network. It enforces security policies and ensures that users and devices meet certain requirements, like having the right credentials or meeting security standards. 
- In a nutshell, Cisco ISE helps maintain network security by controlling who gets in and what they can do once they're connected.

## How it works 
Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) is a powerful tool that helps ensure the security and integrity of computer networks. As a network engineer, understanding how ISE works is crucial for implementing effective network access control and maintaining a secure environment. At its core, Cisco ISE acts as a gatekeeper for your network, deciding who can access it and under what conditions. Here's a simplified breakdown of how it works:

- Identity Verification: When a user or device wants to connect to the network, ISE first verifies their identity. This is done by asking for credentials like usernames and passwords, or by using other methods like digital certificates or even biometric information.

- Device Profiling: ISE examines the connecting device to understand its type, operating system, and security status. This helps ISE determine whether the device meets the security requirements set by the organization. For example, it can identify whether the device is a laptop, smartphone, printer, etc.

- Policy Enforcement: Based on the user's identity and the device's profile, ISE enforces network access policies. These policies define what actions are allowed or denied. For instance, a policy might specify that only employees with certain roles can access sensitive data, or that only devices with up-to-date antivirus software can connect.

- Authentication and Authorization: ISE checks the user's credentials to authenticate them and then evaluates whether they are authorized to access the requested resources. Authentication confirms the user's identity, while authorization determines what they are allowed to do once connected.

- Integration with Network Devices: ISE communicates with network devices like switches, routers, and wireless access points. When a device connects to the network, ISE communicates with it to apply the appropriate access policies. If the device and user meet the criteria, access is granted. If not, access is denied or restricted.

- Monitoring and Reporting: ISE continuously monitors network activity. It can detect suspicious behavior or policy violations and take action accordingly. It also generates reports and logs that network administrators can use to track access, troubleshoot issues, and demonstrate compliance.

In summary, Cisco ISE is like a security guard for your network. It checks who's trying to enter, verifies their identity and device, ensures they follow the rules, and keeps a watchful eye on what's happening. This helps organizations maintain a secure network environment by allowing authorized users and devices while keeping out potential threats. As a network engineer, your role involves configuring and managing ISE to align with your organization's security policies and network requirements.
